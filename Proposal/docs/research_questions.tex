\textbf{How is climate change going to affect tree species with different allocation strategies?}\\
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item How does changing climatic conditions influence the allocation of resources between growth and reproduction in trees with different allocation strategies?
	\item How do interactions between climate change-induced stressors (high temperature, drought) and the growth-reproduction trade-off influence tree growth and reproductive success?
	\item How do different stress from climate change (high temperature, drought) impact the reproductive efforts of tree, how does that change the relationship between growth and reproduction?
	\item What role do environmental cues and physiological factors play in triggering mast seeding events in the context of changing climatic conditions.
	\item Is mast seeding a successful strategy for these trees species under climate change context? (Considering competition and regeneration success)
	\item For trees growing at different elevations, how are they going to respond to expanding growing season differently, what climatic factors affect their growth the most.
	\item Is that possible to link functional traits, seed traits to their change of allocation strategy responding to climate change.

\textbf{Likelihood for Seed Production}\\
Growth data is on individual level, while seed data is on stand level, so I will model individual tree radial growth and stand-level seed production by introducing \(\mu_{j,sp,y}\), representing the mean radial growth for stand \(j\), species \(sp\), and year \(y\).


For each individual tree \(i\) in stand \(j\), species \(sp\), and year \(y\), the observed radial growth is modeled as, with \(sigma\) being the variance across individuals:

\[
\text{Growth}_{j,sp,y[i]} \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{j,sp,y}, \sigma^2)
\]

The seed count for a particular stand \(j\), species \(sp\), and year \(y\) follows a negative binomial distribution with mean \(\lambda_{j,sp,y}\) and dispersion term \(\phi\):

\[
\text{Seed}_{j,sp,y} \sim \text{NegBinomial}(\lambda_{j,sp,y}, \phi)
\]

The modeled seed count (\(\lambda_{j,sp,y}\)) for stand \(j\), species \(sp\), and year \(y\) is:

\[
\log(\lambda_{j, sp, y}) =\alpha_{0} + \alpha_{sp} + \alpha_{j} + (\beta_{1 sp} + \beta_{1 j}) \cdot \mu_{j,sp,y} + (\beta_{2 sp} + \beta_{2 j}) \cdot \mu_{j,sp,y-1} + \beta_{3 sp} \cdot \text{Elevation}_{j}
\]

Where:\\
\(\alpha_{0}\) is the grand mean across all species, stands and years;\\
\(\alpha_{sp}\) is the species-specific intercept for species sp;\\
\(\alpha_{j}\) is the stand-specific intercept for stand j;\\
\(\beta_{1 sp}\) is the slope for the relationship between current-year growth and seed production for species \(sp\);\\
\(\beta_{1 j}\) is the slope for the relationship between current-year growth and seed production for stand \(j\);\\
\(\mu_{j,sp,y}\) is the mean growth for stand \(j\), species \(sp\), and year \(y\);\\
\(\beta_{2 sp}\) is the slope for the relationship between previous-year growth and seed production as the lag effect for species \(sp\);\\
\(\beta_{2 j}\) is the slope for the relationship between previous-year growth and seed production as the lag effect for stand \(j\);\\
\(\beta_{3 sp}\) is the effect of elevation on seed production for species \(sp\).\\

\textbf{Priors for Random Slopes}
\[
\beta_{1 sp} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\beta_1 sp})
\]
\[
\beta_{2 sp} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\beta_2 sp})
\]
\[
\beta_{1 j} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\beta_1 j})
\]
\[
\beta_{2 j} \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\beta_2 j})
\]

Where:\\
\(\sigma_{\beta_1 sp}\) and \(\sigma_{\beta_2 sp}\) represent the standard deviations for the random slopes at the species level;\\
\(\sigma_{\beta_1 j}\) and \(\sigma_{\beta_2 j}\) represent the standard deviations for the random slopes at the stand level.

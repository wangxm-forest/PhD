-> Amy asked about categorical masting (yes/no or continuous) and about
previous literature (need better overview of what is found and better
predictions for what you will find).
-> Angio versus gymnosperms question by Sally
-> Map includes more stands than sampled (update)
-> 15 years of seed trap data

Weather during bud formation; weather during bud fertilization will
matter. Another possible source of data -- commercial seed collection
data at BC Tree Seed Center, where they process all the cones they
collect. Some collect from seed orchards, some collect from other areas.
Would provide cool information on mast years. Sally has info on who to
get in touch with (David, seed scientist -- she can send the email
address).

Grand fir shows reduced growth when pollen cones are produced (seen
visually along the branches in the botanical garden).
* Interesting point as this is about vegetative growth ... versus woody
growth. Wonder if there are citations for vegetative growth.

Review literature by John Owens (technical reports) for seed formation.

Is there a relationship between seed size and masting? Sally expects
there should be for the seed satiation hypothesis.

* What three things determine statistical power?
* Differentiate chapter 1 (your work) from published work.

Try to get proposal done sooner so you can readings for your qualifying
exam. Make sure you allow enough time to study for your qualifying exams
(don't feel like you have to rush it).
Make sure you allow 6 weeks to prep for qualifying exam. Maybe submit
proposal in January if you want to do quals in March.

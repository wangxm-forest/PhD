Mao Committee Member Invitation Letter

Dear Dr. Angert,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Xiaomao Wang, and I am a first-year PhD student working with Lizzie Wolkovich. I previously completed my MSc with Inéz Ibáñez at University of Michigan. My PhD research will explore how climate affects tree species with different growth-reproduction allocation strategies. I plan to focus on growth-reproduction trade-offs and environmental cues in trees that mast working at Mount Rainier and also possibly doing some global analyses.

I am in the process of forming my committee as I am about to start my project, and I would like to have experts who can provide valuable insights from the very beginning of my project.

I think your research about eco-evolutionary responses to climate and demographic compensation across species' ranges would be very beneficial to my project. In addition to the intersection with growth-reproductive trade-offs, one of my research questions will be focused on how trees growing at different elevations will respond to climate change differently. 

I expect to have my first committee meeting in the fall, and hope you would consider joining my committee? I am happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail and/or answer any questions you have in person or over email. 

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Mao

Dear Dr. Aitken,

I think your research on local adaptation of temperate and boreal tree species to climate will be very beneficial to my project.

I expect to have my first committee meeting in the fall, and hope you would consider joining my committee? I am happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the project in more detail and/or answer any questions you have in person or over email.
